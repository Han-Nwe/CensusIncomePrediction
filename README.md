# CensusIncomePrediction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of machine learning models to predict income levels based on the Census Income dataset. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, classification, clustering, and neural network modeling, all implemented in a single Python script.

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop predictive models for classification tasks using the Census Income dataset. We employ diverse machine learning algorithms, optimization methods, and clustering techniques to achieve our goals.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `age`
- `workclass`
- `fnlwgt`
- `education`
- `education-num`
- `marital-status`
- `occupation`
- `relationship`
- `sex`
- `capital-gain`
- `capital-loss`
- `hours-per-week`
- `native-country`
- `income`

## Data Exploration
Begin with data exploration through visualization to understand the dataset's structure and distribution.

## Modeling
### Logistic Regression
A Logistic Regression model is trained to establish baseline performance, achieving 80% accuracy.

### Random Forest
A Random Forest model is implemented to improve classification performance.

### K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is used to identify patterns and groupings within the data.

### Agglomerative Clustering
Agglomerative Clustering is employed for hierarchical clustering.

### Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
A Feedforward Neural Network is implemented to capture intricate data relationships.

## Optimization
Optimization techniques are applied to improve the performance of each model.

## Conclusion
This project encompasses data exploration, preparation, and application of various machine learning methods, yielding valuable predictive models. Optimization underscored the significance of fine-tuning, and a holistic understanding emerged from both supervised and unsupervised learning.
